Face Recognition Attendance System
The advancements in computer vision and machine learning technologies have revolutionized various aspects of our lives. One such significant application is face recognition, which has gained prominence in the field of biometrics. Face recognition-based attendance systems are emerging as an innovative solution to streamline attendance management in various settings, ranging from educational institutions to corporate offices.

This project aims to develop a robust and efficient face recognition-based attendance system that eliminates the need for traditional paper-based or card-based attendance tracking methods. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and facial recognition algorithms, this system offers a seamless, automated, and secure approach to monitor and record attendance.
